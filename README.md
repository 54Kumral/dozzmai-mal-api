# dozzmai-mal-api
A basic (experimental) mal api for .net. It is planned to have methods and classes for user authentication, anime/manga queries and user anime/manga list management.

## Intended Functions
* Querying anime and manga data from myanimelist for any application type that could be developed using .NET framework
* Give developers an API that can add/update/delete animes from a user's anime/manga list for easier project creation
* Self developed data structures for easier data management
* And many more features I haven't thought of, yet... :D
