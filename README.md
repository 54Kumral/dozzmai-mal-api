# dozzmai-mal-api
A basic (experimental) mal api for .net. It is planned to have methods and classes for user authentication, anime/manga queries and user anime/manga list management.

# IMPORTANT NOTICE!!
MALClient's first version, which will only support AnimeList features, has been completed with a fully functional AnimeListManager! Search, Query, and manage your anime list on MAL using your own client with DozzMai MAL Api!
* AnimeSearch      : Search animes on MAL
* AnimeListManager : Manage your anime list and view either your or other people's anime lists. For detailed information, refer to our wiki

MALQueries Rock! Create your own methods easier using MALQueries!
* DozzMai MAL Api now utilized MALQuery objects such as MALSearchQuery, MALAddQuery etc. to Add, Update, Delete animes to and from the authenticated user's anime list
* By using MALGetQuery, you can either get the authenticated user's anime list, or any other user's anime list!
* By using MALSearchQuery, you can search any anime on MAL

## Intended Functions
* Querying anime and manga data from myanimelist for any application type that could be developed using .NET framework
* Give developers an API that can add/update/delete animes from a user's anime/manga list for easier project creation
* Self developed data structures for easier data management
* And many more features I haven't thought of, yet... :D
